1. Program itself is structured as :
    a/Constants
    b/Global Variables
        a1/window = 
        a2/the_forest = None
    c/Graphics Funciton
        b1/on_draw() window event
    d/Project Classes
    e/Application
        d1/Class App
            def run():
                global the_forest #the_forest is declared as the global variabel 
                the_forest = Forest() #now instantiate it here


2. Take all the constants out and declare at the beginning 
    (Also assign values)
    (Including all the delta values):
    - WINDOW_WIDTH
    - WINDOW_HEIGHT
    - WINDOW_MARGIN
    - TREE_SIZE_MIN
    - TREE_SIZE_MAX
    - N_TREES_MIN
    - N_TREES_MAX
    - BABY_DY_MIN
    - BABY_DY_MAX
    - BABY_DX_MIN
    - BABY_DX_MAX
    - BABY_SIZE
    - ADULT_SIZE
    - MOVE_LIMIT

3. When drawing the tree, use the x,y as the center of the bottom of the trunk,
    and apply to the offset of x and y only, e.g.(x-(size*0.56), y+(size*0.36))


Design point:
1. How do we remember things? in Objects? in global variables?
2. Does that object needs this information?
3. How do we move data from place to place? put into a parameter? call that parameter/Constants 
4. Subclassing (Flyer's - slight variation. Put the variation in the subclass's move() and then 
    call super's move() method.) -> Decorator Pattern. This function is the decorator of that function. 
5. All the animals could be put into a Interface. 

class AnimalGroup:
    """
    This is an interface for Family and Flock to show the methods they have in common 
    """
    def move(self):
        pass
    def draw(self):
        pass
6. When getting more formal, Animal class goes into a separate module, so is AnimalGroup.
   Minimize the coupling. Also have to split the constants into separate modules. 
7. Standard Configuration for python files. ## To Search (Add a config file and read it into the main program)
